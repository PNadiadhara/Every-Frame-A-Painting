# Every Frame A Painting

Sometimes a movie or video can be so well crafted that every frame may as well be a painting (Such is the case with Spider-man Into the Spider-Verse). The goal of this project is to be able to admire every frame of a clip and be able to use the images as desktop wallpapers.
